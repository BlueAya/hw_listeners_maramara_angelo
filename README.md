## Comments
- Event listeners are awesome! I see so many potential uses for it in the future and I look forward to delving deeper with them as I begin using them in personal projects.
- As I was reviewing my work in the Form Branch, I realized that I did not use the 'submit' event. I had originally had a 'click' event in its place. I corrected it, but I left the original in my code as a comment. I was just curious, would the commented out version also be acceptable? Or does it depend on what you're trying to achieve?
